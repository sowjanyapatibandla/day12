        <h2>
            Q 1 : Explain absolute and relative position by using example and with words as well
        </h2>
        <div class="relative">
            <pre>
        position :relative;
            top: 100px;
            left: 100px;
            </pre>
            <p>It is always related to its next element or siblings so that when we give it a left and top property it moves from the sibling to specified postion, like in this example it moved 100px left and top  from the above element </p>
        </div>
        <div class="absolute">
            <pre>position: absolute;
                top: 200px;
                left: 400px;</pre>
                <p>It is relative to its parent element if parent element is not present it will go for root element, when parent element has the position as specified as related then it will be totally relative the dimenssions of the parent</p>

        <h2>
            Q 2 : Explain the difference between fixed and sticky
        </h2>
        <div class="ques2">
            <p><strong>Fixed - </strong>
                The property fixed is relative to the viewport ,  when we apply position fixed property it gets fixed to that position so it doesn't move when we scroll the page up or down. <br>
                It doesn't takes the additional space of the page and doesn't disturb other elements.
                
            </p>
            <p><strong>Sticky - </strong> 
                The propery Sticky is scrollable until we scroll the page till our specified position then as it reaches the specified position it becomes fixed at that position ex- is navbar. <br> It takes the space in the page and it will displace the other elements.
